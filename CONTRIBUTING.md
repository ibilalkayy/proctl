### **Process for Accepting Contributions**

To contribute to the Linux for Pirates! guide, please follow these steps:

**Open an issue** 

Before you start working on a contribution, we recommend opening an issue to discuss it with the team. This will allow us to provide feedback and guidance, and ensure that your contribution is in line with the goals and vision of the project.

> **Note:** No pull requests will be accepted without an issue, except in specific cases that will be approved on an ad-hoc basis.

To open an issue, go to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ibilalkayy/proctl/issues) and click the "New Issue" button. Provide a clear and concise description of your proposed contribution, and any relevant details or questions.

**Fork the repository**

A repository is a collection of files that make up the Linux for Pirates! guide. To contribute to the guide, you'll need to create a copy of the repository on your own GitHub account. This is called "forking" the repository.

To fork the repository, go to the main page of the Linux for Pirates! repository on GitHub and click the "Fork" button. This will create a copy of the repository on your own account.

**Clone the repository**

Now that you have a copy of the repository on your own account, you'll need to download it to your computer so you can make changes to it. This is called "cloning" the repository.

To clone the repository, open a terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:

```bash
`git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/proctl.git`
```

Replace `"YOUR-USERNAME"` with your actual GitHub username. This will download the repository to your computer.

**Create a new branch**

When you make changes to the proctl project, you should do so it in a separate branch. This is a good practice because it allows you to test your changes without affecting the main branch of the repository.

To create a new branch, enter the following command in the terminal:

```bash
`git branch NEW-BRANCH-NAME`
```

Replace `"NEW-BRANCH-NAME"` with a descriptive name for your branch.

**Switch to the new branch**

Now that you've created a new branch, you need to switch to it. Enter the following command in the terminal:

```bash
`git checkout NEW-BRANCH-NAME`
```

**Make your changes**

Open the files in the proctl repository in your text editor and make the changes you want to contribute.

**Commit your changes**

When you're finished making changes, you need to "commit" them to the repository. This is like saving your changes, but it also allows you to add a message explaining what you did.

To commit your changes, enter the following command in the terminal:

```bash
`git commit -am "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"`
```

Replace `"YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"` with a brief description of your changes.

**Push your changes to GitHub**

Now that you've committed your changes, you need to "push" them to your fork of the repository on GitHub. This will make your changes visible to the rest of the team.

To push your changes, enter the following command in the terminal:

```bash
`git push origin NEW-BRANCH-NAME`
```

**Submit a pull request**

Once you've pushed your changes to GitHub, you can submit a "pull request" to merge your changes into the main branch of the repository.

To submit a pull request, go to the main page of your fork of the repository on GitHub and click the "Compare and pull request" button. Provide a clear and concise description of your changes and any relevant details or questions.

The team will review your pull request and provide feedback as needed. Once your pull request has been reviewed and accepted, it will be merged into the main branch of the repository.
